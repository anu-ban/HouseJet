# HOUSEJET PHP Evaluation
This is a series of programming problems designed to help us gauge how proficient
you are in PHP.

You will find multiple `.php` files in the Tests folder. Open the files and
complete the functions and classes within.

You can run the individual tests to see if all the assertions pass. In this case
no output is what you should expect (unless you've added output for debugging).

If you want to run all the tests you can run the `Evaluation.php` file or run it 
through docker by running `docker compose up`. In both cases you should
expect no output if everything passes the assertions. If it fails an assertion you will see
output describing the nature of the failure.
